/**
 * Where an overlay sits, as a pure function of four rectangles.
 *
 * A menu opens next to the control that owns it, and the control can be
 * anywhere: at the foot of a list that scrolls, or in a deep row of a narrow
 * sidebar. An overlay that is laid out inside that scrolling box is cut by it,
 * because a box that scrolls on one axis clips on both. The menu therefore
 * leaves the box and takes a place in the coordinates of the screen.
 *
 * A place on the screen is two numbers that only the browser can measure, so
 * it cannot be a utility class. This module is the one place that decides
 * those numbers, and `./menu.tsx` is the one place that writes them. Every
 * other decision of an overlay, its colour, its edge, its radius, its padding
 * and its depth, stays in the named scales. See
 * [decision 0058](../../../docs/decisions/0058-an-overlay-is-placed-on-the-screen.md).
 *
 * The room is the visible part of the screen (`./visible-area.ts`), so a menu
 * that opens while the keyboard of a phone is up stays above the keyboard.
 *
 * Nothing here reads the document, so `./overlay-position.test.ts` holds every
 * rule without a browser.
