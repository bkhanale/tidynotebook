/**
 * How the workspace accepts the text work of a save (record 0081).
 *
 * Every accepted text of a note comes through here: a save from a device, an
 * import, a restore from History or Trash, and the link rewrites that follow
 * a move. The rule is the same for each of them, so no writer can reach the
 * text of a note by another path.
 *
 * The order of the checks is the rule:
 *
 * 1. The generation must match. Identities of one generation say nothing
 *    about another, so a save of another epoch is refused before anything
 *    else reads its bytes.
 * 2. The complete observed state decides two questions: whether this save
 *    joins work that the device had not seen, which marks the revision as
 *    merged, and whether a deletion would hide such work, which refuses the
 *    deletion (record 0083).
 * 3. The update applies to a trial document. A refusal leaves the stored
 *    document exactly as it was.
 * 4. A save keeps one state in each task box that it and another editor
 *    wrote into, so two toggles of one box never leave it with two states
 *    (record 0134).
 * 5. The workspace derives the text of the revision from the result, so the
 *    stored text and the document can never disagree.
