/**
 * The foreground sync state machine.
 *
 * One run of the engine repeats the revision exchange of the design:
 *
 * 1. Hold the single worker lease, renewing it every cycle, or read the gate
 *    of the lease keeper that holds it for the tab (record 0130). Another tab
 *    with a live lease keeps this run from starting; an expired lease is
 *    taken over. Tab messages only announce these states.
 * 2. Verify the session and the workspace membership before touching data.
 *    An expired session pauses the run with drafts kept. A session of
 *    another account pauses the run too, because one browser profile holds
 *    one session cookie and the queue of this account must not go up with
 *    the cookie of another (record 0113). A lost membership stops reads and
 *    writes. A downgrade to viewer suspends writes while permitted reads
 *    continue, and resumes them when the role is restored.
 * 3. Read the sync protocol versions that the server serves. A client that
 *    does not fit sends nothing and pulls nothing, keeps every draft and
 *    queued save, and announces the misfit once (record 0086).
 * 4. Submit the queued mutations in parent order through `pushQueue`, which
 *    freezes each mutation on first send, batches unsent chains atomically,
 *    branches on stale heads, and preserves anything the server refuses.
 * 5. Pull the server state through `pullPages`: stage a snapshot, fetch its
 *    immutable revisions, activate only when complete, then consume ordered
 *    changes until an empty page. A dirty working copy is never replaced.
 * 6. Wait for the poll interval and repeat until the abort signal fires.
 *
 * Every application HTTP call below is a direct import of a generated
 * operation function. There is no handwritten transport: this module only
 * maps domain records to generated bodies and generated answers back to
 * domain outcomes.
