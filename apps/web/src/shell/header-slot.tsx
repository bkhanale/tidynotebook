/**
 * The two places a route writes into the frame header.
 *
 * The header is the context of the route: the sidebar toggle and the
 * breadcrumb on the left, then the actions of the route, then Search and the
 * account. The frame cannot know those actions, because they belong to the
 * screen, and the screen cannot reach the header, because it renders below
 * it. This module is the one link between the two. See
 * [decision 0064](../../../../docs/decisions/0064-the-frame-header-is-the-context-of-the-route.md).
 *
 * The last part of the breadcrumb is the second place. It names the route, so
 * a route that writes that name itself, such as the note route with its name
 * field, claims the part and the frame draws no word of its own. See
 * [decision 0069](../../../../docs/decisions/0069-the-note-name-is-the-last-part-of-the-breadcrumb.md).
 *
 * A slot is a portal and not a node held in state. A route passes a new
 * element on every render, so a provider that kept the element in state would
 * set that state from the route, re-render the route, and receive a new
 * element again: one render loop with no fixed point. A portal writes the
 * nodes of the route into an element of the header, so React owns the order,
 * the keys and the clean up, and the header re-renders only when the header
 * changes.
 *
 * A claim is a count and not a flag. React runs every clean up of one commit
 * before every effect of it, so a move from one note to the next gives the
 * part back and takes it again, and a count reaches the same number it
 * started at while a flag would end up false.
 *
 * The shell renders one `HeaderSlot` and one `HeaderLeafSlot` inside the
 * header, and each route renders at most one `HeaderActions` and one
 * `HeaderLeaf`. A screen with neither leaves the middle empty and keeps the
 * word of the frame.
