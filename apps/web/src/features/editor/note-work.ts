/**
 * The writes of one open editor to this device (records 0022, 0133, 0175,
 * 0181).
 *
 * A key reaches the disk one frame after it reaches the editor: each frame
 * appends the work of its keys to the document of the note, with no decode
 * of the document. A hidden tab and the end of the screen append at once,
 * because a hidden tab runs no frame.
 *
 * After a failed append the editor appends nothing more: the work waits in
 * the editor, and the next version writes the whole document first, which
 * holds every change. A read of the stored document that lacks a change the
 * store took, as after a snapshot that replaced the row, has the same result.
 * An append that started before the failure was known can build on the work
 * that failed, and the store leaves it out until the whole document arrives.
 *
 * The draft is recovery data and follows after a pause. It states the state
 * vector of the document only after the store took every change that the
 * vector names, because a state vector does not count a deletion.
 *
 * A version freezes the stored document, so it writes the work first and
 * claims only the changes whose work it wrote. A key that arrives while it
 * runs gets a version of its own. A version that writes no draft, because it
 * failed or wrote nothing, asks for the draft at once: the draft write that
 * waited was cancelled for it.
 *
 * The ports are injected, so a unit test drives the store and the frames.
